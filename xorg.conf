  # DPMS settings to keep monitors from automatically turning off.
  #
  # Especially useful to keep my laptop screen from turning itself off
  # while I'm watching videos.
  #
  # explanation {{{
  # DPMS is "Display Power Management Signaling," enabling power-saving
  # for monitors when the computer is not in use. On modern LCD displays,
  # there is usually no difference between "Standby," "Suspend," and "Off"
  # modes (DPMS was originally developed for CRT, for which monitors'
  # different modes had different power consumptions - modern LCDs don't
  # have different power modes, just "off" and "on").
